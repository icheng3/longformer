# Improving Self-Attention Mechanisms for Long Document Classification
This is a reimplementation of the [Longformer](https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/master/longformer) architecture constructed by AllenAI to for multi-class classification of book genres by text. <br />
Original docstrings as written by AllenAI in the forked file were kept for ease of understanding. <br />
The training, testing, and original dataset can be found [here]().
